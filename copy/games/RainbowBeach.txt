Rainbow Beach (Late 2018 - Mid 2019) - Team Project

Description
Rainbow Beach is a colour mixing puzzle game where you explore island unlocking chests and navigating obstacles using your drum to create and aura around yourself which interects with the environment.

The game contains elements of speed and reactions as you try to match up colours.
