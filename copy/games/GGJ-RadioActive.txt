GGJ Radio Active (January 2018) - Team Project

Description
Radio Active is a puzzle game made over a weekend during the 2018 global Game Jam, inspired by the prompt "transmission".

The player uses the mouse scroll wheel to tune a radio to different stations


The team and my roles
4 people were involved in this game, all of which were doing roles which they don't traditionally do. An artist, a designer, an audio engineer, and a programmer.

I created all the audio for this game during the game jam using Ableton live 10, I also did some programming throughout the project, although this wasn't my main focus.
