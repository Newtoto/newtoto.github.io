VR Rooftop Sniper (December 2017) - Solo Project

Description
This prototype was created for the Vive and made in Unity with SteamVR. An Arduino, sliding potentiometer and button was also used, along with a vive tracker and a custom spring mechanism in order to explore alternative forms of feedback outside of the standard vive controllers.

Progress pictures and videos are available in the Github repo, which is linked below.


Challenges
Since my access to tools and materials was limited, the gun model and firing mechanism was made out of recycled boxes and pringles tubes, a peg, bearings, allen keys, a spring, cable ties and a lot of duct tape. This meant that the strength was limited and I couldn't make the firing mechanism as powerful as I would have liked.

Trying to combine both electronic and mechanical parts made this considerably more difficult, because it meant that 1 button had to give a digital signal and fire the mechanism. As well as this, the reload had to load the mechanism and send over values to show its physical location.
