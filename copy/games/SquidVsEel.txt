Squid Vs Eel (December 2016) - Team Project

Description
Squid VS Eel is a 2 player couch competitive game programmed in python using pygame.

It is played by sharing a single keyboard with each player taking on the role of either the squid or the eel, each possessing a set of unique abilities designed to inflict damage, or counter the opponent's attacks.

The use of cooldowns introduces an element of timing and skill.


The team and my contribution
The team consisted of 4 programmers, including myself.

For this game I was involved with both programming and design along with the 3 others, as well as making animations and procedurally generated music. This was my first Pygame project.
