Descension (March 2017) - Team Project

Description
Descension is a first person melee hoard survival game made in UE4.

It is set in the underworld and created by Demon Crypt. Fight your way through masses of disturbing creatures with a hammer or dual axes in order to unleash as much havoc as you can, before your inevitable death that is.


The team and my contribution
The Demon Crypt team consisted of 11 people, 3 programmers (including myself), 4 artists, 2 designers, 1 audio engineer and 1 animator. I was a dedicated programmer for this game, working on various aspects such as AI and a weapon switching system.

This was my first game project in UE4.
