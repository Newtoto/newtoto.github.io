GGJ Make It (January 2019) - Team Project

Description
Make it is a top down 3rd person game made in UE4 where the player destroys the environment in order to upgrade their home.

The more they destroy their surroundings, the more poluted its appearance becomes until the player is in a treeless woods with rubbish in the water.

The team and my roles
As with all global game jams I have focussed on something other than programming to gain insight into other roles.

For this jam I was working on 3D environment art and learning to use maya for the first time. I also made the sound effects and music for the game. The team for this consisted of 2 programmers, 3 artists, and an animator.
