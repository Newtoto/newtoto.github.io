Crossbeam (April 2017) - Solo Project

Crossbeam is a 2D puzzle game made in UE4 where you shoot 4 turrets to around obstacles in order to hit targets.
This game is designed with a custom controller in mind which was made using a button, 2 potentiometers and an Arduino.

Challenges
I wanted the game to be fully controllable without the use of a keyboard and mouse, so I implemented a menu and level selection which could be navigated using this controller.
The main challenge with this project was that 4 potentiometers resulted in incomplete values being sent to unreal. After sanity checking the values coming in, there wasn't enough valid numbers being received to get a responsive 3rd and 4th turret. For this reason I ended up reducing the number to 2 which meant that I had to make the game work with fewer inputs.
