						<p>
							Shield Man is a hardcore 2D action platformer inspired by games such as super meat boy, with level time trials and humorous aspects. It is made in Unity.
						</p>
						<p>
							You play as a knight who is on a quest to retrieve his princess, who also happens to be his sword. You navigate by bashing your shield against floors and walls instead of the more traditional running and jumping platformer mechanics.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is the second game from Slender Loris after the team decided to step away from the development of Cookoo.

						<h3>The team and my roles</h3>
						<p>
							This is the second game from Slender Loris after the team decided to step away from the development of Cookoo. Slender Loris consists of 10 students. 3 programmers (including myself), 2 artists, 3 designers, 1 audio engineer and 1 animator.
						</p>
						<p>
							My main role on this project was gameplay programming, alongside elements of AI, save files, and menu navigation.

							I created all the audio for this game during the game jam using ableton live 10, I also did some programming throughout the project, although this wasn't my main focus.

							This prototype was created for the Vive and made in Unity with SteamVR. An Arduino, sliding potentiometer and button was also used, along with a vive tracker and a custom spring mechanism in order to explore alternative forms of feedback outside of the standard vive controllers.

						<p>
							Progress pictures and videos are available in the Github repo, which is linked below.
						</p>
						</br>
						<h3>Challenges</h3>
						<p>
							Since my access to tools and materials was limited, the gun model and firing mechanism was made out of recycled boxes and pringles tubes, a peg, bearings, allen keys, a spring, cable ties and a lot of duct tape. This meant that the strength was limited and I couldn't make the firing mechanism as powerful as I would have liked.
						</p>
						<p>
							Trying to combine both electronic and mechanical parts made this considerably more difficult, because it meant that 1 button had to give a digital signal and fire the mechanism. As well as this, the reload had to load the mechanism and send over values to show its physical location.

							Cookoo is currently an assymetrical couch co-op game in which one player drives, while the other player cooks in the back. This is made in Unity.

							This game is still in progress and has plans to change dramatically over the course of the next year. These changes involve making the game a competitive game where both players cook in a fast paced mini-game style and then drive. The goal will be to grow your pancake business the most.

							Crossbeam is a 2D puzzle game made in UE4 where you shoot 4 turrets to around obstacles in order to hit targets.

							This game is designed with a custom controller in mind which was made using a button, 2 potentiometers and an Arduino.
						</p>
						</br>
						<h3>Challenges</h3>
						<p>
							I wanted the game to be fully controllable without the use of a keyboard and mouse, so I implemented a menu and level selection which could be navigated using this controller.
						</p>
						<p>
							The main challenge with this project was that 4 potentiometers resulted in incomplete values being sent to unreal. After sanity checking the values coming in, there wasn't enough valid numbers being received to get a responsive 3rd and 4th turret. For this reason I ended up reducing the number to 2 which meant that I had to make the game work with fewer inputs.
