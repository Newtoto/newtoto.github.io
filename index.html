			<h3>Ecommerce Strategies Ltd (ECS) - Front End Web Developer</h3>
			<p>ECS is a small Magento specialist ecommerce web development company in affiliation with Vaimo. I worked there full time for around 1 year starting late 2015.
			The specific jobs that my role entailed and the skills I learned are outlined below.</p>
			<p><span class = "boldUnderline">Front-end web development:</span> Using HTML, CSS, and PHP I edited Magento templates to realise the custom designs and specifications of the customer along with a team.
			 As a result of this work, I am also familiar with grunt, gulp and less, as well as editing sites and pushing site changes using command line tools. </p>
			<p><span class = "boldUnderline">Formatting product databases:</span> Using excel formulae on up to 40,000 unique SKUs at a time, I formatted product lists with their categories and information for the import into Magento using the "Magmi" mass product importer and Sequel Pro. 
			 This involved the import of both simple products and more complex configurable ones.</p>
			<p><span class = "boldUnderline">Writing blog posts:</span> Over my time at ECS, I wrote around 20 blog posts about various topics surrounding ecommerce, such as SEO. Among these were posts about ECS's customers' site launches.</p>
			<p><span class = "boldUnderline">Customer training:</span> When new customers needed to learn about how to operate their website, such as adding new products, categories, and pages, I would give them a training session.
			 As a result, I have an in depth understanding of backend magento, and to a lesser extent, magento 2. I have also improved at teaching how to operate software in a simple to understand manner.</p>
			<p><span class = "boldUnderline">QA Testing:</span> This involved thoroughly testing the websites on a number of different browsers and devices, looking for potential issues that customers might have.</p>

			<h3>Techademy volunteering</h3>
			<p>Techademy is a 2 day long session designed to teach primary and secondary school staff how to code using the raspberry pi and various other technologies such as the BBC micro and Makey Makey kit. 
			The aim of this is that that they with then be able to pass on this knowledge onto their students and encourage more uptake and understanding in the field of computer programming.</p>
			<p>As a volunteer, I assisted the teachers with any issues that they had while learning to code. On the second day, the attendees also undertook a tech-jam style project to make something.
			The teachers I was assisting with this were using the Makey Makey kit in order to make an educational game with a custom controller for which I guided the python programming for.</p>
