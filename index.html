		<h2>Experience</h2>
		<h3>Ecommerce Strategies Ltd (ECS) - Front End Web Developer</h3>
		<p>ECS is a Magento specialist ecommerce web development company in affiliation with Vaimo, at the time there were around . I worked there full time for around 1 year starting late 2015.
		The specific jobs that my role entailed and the skills I learned are outlined below.</p>
		<p><span class = "boldUnderline">Front-end web development:</span> Using HTML, CSS, and PHP I edited Magento templates to realise the custom designs and specifications of the customer along with a team.
		 As a result of this work, I am also familiar with grunt, gulp and less, as well as editing sites and pushing site changes using command line tools. </p>
		<p><span class = "boldUnderline">Formatting product databases:</span> Using excel formulae on up to 40,000 unique SKUs at a time, I formatted product lists with their categories and information for the import into Magento using the "Magmi" mass product importer and Sequel Pro. 
		 This involved the import of both simple products and more complex configurable ones.</p>
		<p><span class = "boldUnderline">Writing blog posts:</span> Over my time at ECS, I wrote around 20 blog posts about various topics surrounding ecommerce, such as SEO. Among these were posts about the company's site launches.</p>
		<p><span class = "boldUnderline">Customer training:</span> When new customers needed to learn about how to operate their website, such as adding new products, categories, and pages, I would give them a training session.
		 As a result, I have an in depth understanding of backend magento, and to a lesser extent, magento 2. I have also improved at teaching how to operate software in a simple to understand manner.
