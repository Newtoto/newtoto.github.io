							Since my access to tools and materials was limited, the gun model and firing mechanism was made out of recycled boxes and pringles tubes, a peg, bearings, allen keys, a spring, cable ties and a lot of duct tape. This meant that the strength was limited and I couldn't make the firing mechanism as powerful as I would have liked.
						</p>
						<p>
							Trying to combine both electronic and mechanical parts made this considerably more difficult, because it meant that 1 button had to give a digital signal and fire the mechanism. As well as this, the reload had to load the mechanism and send over values to show its physical location.

						<h3>Description</h3>
						<p>
							Crossbeam is a 2D puzzle game made in UE4 where you shoot 4 turrets to around obstacles in order to hit targets.

						<p>
							This game is designed with a custom controller in mind which was made using a button, 2 potentiometers and an Arduino.
						</p>
						</br>
						<h3>Challenges</h3>
						<p>
							I wanted the game to be fully controllable without the use of a keyboard and mouse, so I implemented a menu and level selection which could be navigated using this controller.
						</p>
						<p>
							The main challenge with this project was that 4 potentiometers resulted in incomplete values being sent to unreal. After sanity checking the values coming in, there wasn't enough valid numbers being received to get a responsive 3rd and 4th turret. For this reason I ended up reducing the number to 2 which meant that I had to make the game work with fewer inputs.

						<p>
							If this was just an electronic gun, it would have been easy. If this was just a mechanical gun, it would have been easy. Trying to combine both made this considerably more difficult, because it meant that 1 button had to give a digital signal and fire the mechanism. As well as this, the reload had to load the mechanism and send over values to show its physical location.

						<h3>Description</h3>
						<p>
							Cookoo is currently an assymetrical couch co-op game in which one player drives, while the other player cooks in the back. This is made in Unity.
						</p>
						<p>
							This game is still in progress and has plans to change dramatically over the course of the next year. These changes involve making the game a competitive game where both players cook in a fast paced mini-game style and then drive. The goal will be to grow your pancake business the most.

						<h3>The team and my roles</h3>
						<p>
							The team for this game is made up of 10 students. 3 programmers (including myself), 2 artists, 3 designers, 1 audio engineer and 1 animator.
						</p>
						<p>
							My main roles were programming the driving and the interactions between the driving and the chef. One of the other 2 programmers did the UI, and the other programmed the cooking.

						<h3>Description</h3>
						<p>
							Crossbeam is a 2D puzzle game made in UE4 where you shoot 4 turrets to around obstacles in order to hit targets.
						</p>
						<p>
							This game is designed with a custom controller in mind which was made using a button, 2 potentiometers and an Arduino.
						</p>

						</h3>
						<h3>Challenges</h3>
						<p>
							I wanted the game to be fully controllable without the use of a keyboard and mouse, so I implemented a menu and level selection which could be navigated using this controller.
						</p>
						<p>
							The main challenge with this project was that 4 potentiometers resulted in incomplete values being sent to unreal. After sanity checking the values coming in, there wasn't enough valid numbers being received to get a responsive 3rd and 4th turret. For this reason I ended up reducing the number to 2 which meant that I had to make the game work with fewer inputs.

						<h3>Description</h3>
						<p>
							Squid VS Eel is a 2 player couch competitive game programmed in python using pygame.

							It is played by sharing a single keyboard with each player taking on the role of either the squid or the eel, each possessing a set of unique abilities designed to inflict damage, or counter the opponent's attacks.
						</p>
